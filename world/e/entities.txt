Entities are points in space which get rendered as their respective "sprites" meaning the image which is set in their config. The Image will be rendered as a billboard, meaning there is no front back or side

Animations can be added in the anim folder by creating a new .a file
(Apart from spritesheets and individual sprites, you can also use tiles from a tilemap, defined in the textures folder)
